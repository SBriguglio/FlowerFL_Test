# FL Platform Test: Flower

This repository is the home of my evaluation of the Flower federated learning platform; the aim of which is to better understand 
the extensibility and ease of use of the platform from the researcher's perspective. Specifically, I wish to address 3 
questions.
1. How easy is it to implement different ML models in a FL setting using this platform?
2. Is there a large selection of ML models natively supported by the platform?
3. How easy is it to use different FL architectures (i.e. HFL, VFL, etc.)?
4. Can a custom ML model be used with this platform? If so, what process must be followed and how time-consuming is it?
5. What security features are supported by Flower? Can they be easily modified or extended?

## Environment
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Python 3.10.0
- Flower 0.17.0

*See requirements.txt for complete list of dependencies.*

## Evaluation
Ongoing.
